/*
 1.   Define a class that holds information about a mobile phone device: model, manufacturer, price, owner, battery              characteristics (model, hours idle and hours talk) and display characteristics (size and number of colors). Define 3       separate classes (class GSM holding instances of the classes Battery and Display).
 2.   Define several constructors for the defined classes that take different sets of arguments (the full information for        the class or part of it). Assume that model and manufacturer are mandatory (the others are optional). All unknown          data fill with null.
 3.   Add an enumeration BatteryType (Li-Ion, NiMH, NiCd, …) and use it as a new field for the batteries
 4.   Add a method in the GSM class for displaying all information about it. Try to override ToString().
 5.   Use properties to encapsulate the data fields inside the GSM, Battery and Display classes. Ensure all fields hold          correct data at any given time.
